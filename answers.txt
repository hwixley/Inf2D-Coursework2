PART 1

Task 1.1

PREDICATES:
Road(A, B)        -- A and B are connected by a directed road A=>B
Air(A, B)         -- A and B are connected by a directed air route A=>B
Agent.At(A)       -- The agent is at A
Car.At(A)	  -- The car is at A
Agent.Visited(A)  -- The agent has visited A

INITIAL STATE:
Agent.At(E) ∧ Car.At(E) ∧ ¬Agent.Visited(D)

GOAL STATE:
Agent.At(E) ∧ Agent.Visited(D)


Task 1.2

Drive(A, B) 	-- Drive from A to B
PRECON: Agent.At(A) ∧ Car.At(A) ∧ Road(A, B)
EFFECT: ¬Agent.At(A) ∧ ¬Car.At(A) ∧ Agent.At(B) ∧ Car.At(B)

Fly(A, B) 	-- Fly from A to B
PRECON: Agent.At(A) ∧ Air(A, B)
EFFECT: ¬Agent.At(A) ∧ Agent.At(B)

Visit(A) 	-- Visit A
PRECON: Agent.At(A) ∧ ¬Agent.Visited(A)
EFFECT: Agent.Visited(A)


Task 1.3

BACKWARD STATE SPACE SEARCH
Algorithm which starts at the goal state and ends at the initial state.

BACKWARDS STEPS
Initial state = agent at B, car at A
Goal state = car and agent at E, and agent has visited B

0: Visit(B)	-- Action which completes part of the goal state
1: Fly(B, A)	-- Action which brings our agent closer to the goal state
2: Drive(A, E) 	-- Action which brings our agent to the complete goal state
